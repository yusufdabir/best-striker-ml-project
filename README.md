# ⚽ Best Striker Prediction - ML & EDA Project

This is an end-to-end Machine Learning + Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project to identify the **best-performing football strikers** based on various performance metrics.

The goal was to:
- Clean and transform the raw dataset
- Analyze striker performance across multiple dimensions
- Use clustering and logistic regression to classify striker types
- Build a predictive model to automatically detect the best strikers

## 📁 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Best_Striker_Analysis.ipynb` | Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, plots, and explanations |
| `strikers_cleaned_data.xlsx` | Final cleaned and processed dataset |
| `model_features_x.xlsx` | Feature set used in machine learning model |
| `final_analysis_x_data.xlsx` | Data with clustering, contribution score, and striker type |

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Scipy (for statistical tests)

---

## 📊 Project Highlights

- ✅ Performed detailed EDA on striker stats (goals, assists, accuracy, etc.)
- ✅ Handled missing values with imputation
- ✅ Created new features like **Total Contribution Score**
- ✅ Conducted statistical analysis (Shapiro, Levene, ANOVA, Pearson)
- ✅ Applied **KMeans Clustering** to group strikers
- ✅ Assigned `Best Striker` / `Regular Striker` tags
- ✅ Built a **Logistic Regression** model with 96% accuracy
- ✅ Created confusion matrix to validate performance

---

## 📌 Final Insight

Although global strikers like **Cristiano Ronaldo** were not in the dataset (Portugal not listed), the model effectively classified other players using available data.

> ✅ The project shows how data quality & coverage impacts prediction quality — and how proper EDA + ML can drive actionable insights.
